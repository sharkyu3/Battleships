# Battleships

Battleships is a 2 player game. Players take turns to place 5 ships of varying lengths on a 10x10 grid. 
After both players have placed their ships, they take turns firing at the opponents grid by selecting on a cell of their choice.
If they hit a cell which the opponent had indeed placed a ship, a hit is registered. If not, a miss is registered. 
Players win the game when they successfully sink all 5 of the opponents ships. 

Each round, a random cell on the opponent's board is selected to hide a random weapon. 
If a player finds the treasure chest containing the weapon, it will grant them a power up to use in their next turn. 
The possible power-ups include:
  1. Rain of Fire - player gets to fire at 5 cells of their choice 
  2. Torpedo - player selects a cell and all neighboring cells explode as well
  3. Peek - player gets to click on a cell and take a look whether it contains any ships
